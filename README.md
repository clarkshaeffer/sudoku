# sudoku
Sudoku generator for Python; soon to learn with React Native.

Random Sudoku generation is now fully functional. After cloning, just run the python script: \n
`python3 sudoku.py` \n
and a randomly-generated 9x9 sudoku will appear on your command line, followed by the number of attempts the program took before reaching success.
